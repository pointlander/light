Generate markdown and javascript that reasons about %s.
Two functions are available: console.log(string) which logs to the console and llama.generate(string) which uses a llm to generate text from a prompt.
Code example:
```javascript
 console.log(llama.generate("a prompt"));
```
These are the only available functions and both of them must be used.
