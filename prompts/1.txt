Generate markdown and javascript that reasons about %s.
Two functions are available: console.log(string) which logs to the console and llama.generate(string) which uses a llm to generate text from a prompt.
Code example:
```javascript
 // some reasoning code goes here
 const result = llama.generate("a prompt based on the reasoning")
 // some more reasoning code goes here
 console.log("results of the reasoning");
```
These are the only available functions and both of them must be used, and variables should only be declared once.
